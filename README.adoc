= LaTeX templates 
2019-09-27 

This is my https://www.latex-project.org/[LaTeX] templates. 
It provides the custom packages and document templates I've written and usually use. 




== Style guides 

You can see the style guides from a separate https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-style-guides[Git repo]. 

It mainly follows my style guide for LaTeX documents at https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-style-guides/blob/master/src/latex-docs.adoc[the LaTeX documents style guide]. 
It also follows my writing style guide for writing LaTeX code and the typography for styling LaTeX documents.
